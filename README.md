# G4 (gravity-4)

G4 is a game based on connect-4, with added rotation moves.

It uses a bigger, 8x8 board, and features all the regular connect-4 rules, plus a possibility to rotate the board instead of placing a token during one's turn.

# Rules of the game

# TODO
- Add a maximum-number-of-tokens rule per player.
- Add a 3-fold repetition draw.
