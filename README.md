# G4 (gravity-4)

G4 is an open-source board game inspired by the popular game of connect-4.

It uses a bigger, 8x8 board, and features all the regular connect-4 rules, plus the ability to rotate the board instead of placing a token during one's turn.

## Rules of the game

The rules are similar to connect-4, with added rotation moves.
- players take turns
- they choose from two types of moves:
  - add a token in a column
  - rotate the board, effectively changing the direction of gravity

## State of  repository

The repository is currently in an early stage of development. Huge refactors are to be expected. Tests will be added. APIs will change.

There is not even guarantees that the program can run.

## TODO
- Proper README.
- Add a 3-fold repetition draw.
- Refactor.
- Test.
- Detailed rules of the game.
