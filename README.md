# G4 (gravity-4)

G4 is an open-source board game inspired by the popular game of connect-4.

It uses a bigger, 8x8 board, and features all the regular connect-4 rules, plus the ability to rotate the board instead of placing a token during one's turn.

## State of repository

The repository is currently in an early stage of development. Huge refactors are to be expected. Tests will be added. APIs will change.

It is not even guaranteed the program can run.

## Rules of the game

The rules are similar to connect-4, with added rotation moves.

- Players take turns.
- They choose from two types of moves:
  - add a token in a column,
  - rotate the board, effectively changing the direction of gravity.
- A player wins if she can connect 4 tokens of her color.
